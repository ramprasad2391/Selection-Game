# Selection-Game

This app is a simple game which displays images of five fruits in random quantities in a 5 x 5 grid. A particluar fruit is chosen and the user is asked to find all the locations of that fruit. Every time a correct selection is made,the selected location greys out and the remaining fruits gets re-arranged randomly whilst preserving the remaining quantity of the chosen fruit. A counter keeps on decrementing for every correct selection and once it reaches zero, the user wins the game and a message id displayed. The user loses on making a wrong selection. A reset button is provided to reset the game.
